Here are a few goals for the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continue the &lt;a href="https://github.com/rusty-fast-solvers/roadmap"&gt;rusty-fast-solvers&lt;/a&gt; set of libraries. Our aim is to create versatile parallel tools for the evaluation of Green's function interactions and the fast approximate inversion of integral operators.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Release the next &lt;a href="https://bempp.com"&gt;Bempp-cl&lt;/a&gt; version. Bempp-cl requires quite a bit of internal clean-up, bug fixes, and several other small improvements that warrant a new release version.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lay the foundations for a cluster version of Bempp. Bempp-cl is not designed at all for distributed computations. I am planning to create a low-level cluster library that can assemble operators on distributed systems and integrates with Bempp-cl as driver code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complete a number of papers. In particular, I want to write up our work on black-box coupling of Galerkin boundary elements with fast particle evaluation codes (e.g. FMM, etc.). Moreover, my PhD students have a several great papers in the making.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grant writing. Over the last year we have started a couple of interesting projects. It is time to apply for some more funding for these.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep on Blog writing. I set up this blog a while ago to regularly report on my reseearch progress. But then came covid and teaching stress. No more excuses! The blog waits to be filled.&lt;/li&gt;

As part of a seminar I gave before Christmas Tu Delft performed an interview with me, talking about my career, thoughts on the field and tips for PhD students. The full text can be found &lt;a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/tu-delft-institute-for-computational-science-and-engineering/events/in-conversation-with/timo-betcke/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
