Marking is over and 5 months of uninterrupted research is beginning. Here are a few goals for the coming months.

* Continue the [rusty-fast-solvers](https://github.com/rusty-fast-solvers/roadmap) set of libraries. Our aim is to create versatile parallel tools for the evaluation of Green's function interactions and the fast approximate inversion of integral operators.
* Release the next [Bempp-cl](https://bempp.com) version. Bempp-cl requires quite a bit of internal clean-up, bug fixes, and several other small improvements that warrant a new release version.
* Lay the foundations for a cluster version of Bempp. Bempp-cl is not designed at all for distributed computations. I am planning to create a low-level cluster library that can assemble operators on distributed systems and integrates with Bempp-cl as driver code.
* Complete a number of papers. In particular, I want to write up our work on black-box coupling of Galerkin boundary elements with fast particle evaluation codes (e.g. FMM, etc.). Moreover, my PhD students have a several great papers in the making.
* Grant writing. Over the last year we have started a couple of interesting projects. It is time to apply for some more funding for these.
* Keep on Blog writing. I set up this blog a while ago to regularly report on my reseearch progress. But then came covid and teaching stress. No more excuses! The blog waits to be filled.
